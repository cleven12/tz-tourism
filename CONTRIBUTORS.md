git clone https://github.com/cleven12/tz-tourism.git
cd tz-tourism
```

#### **Step 2: Set Up Backend**
```bash
cd app
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development tools

# Set up database
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser (optional)
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Run tests
pytest

# Start server
python manage.py runserver
```

#### **Step 3: Set Up Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your API URL:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1

# Run tests
npm test

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### **Step 4: Create a Branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

**Branch naming:**
- `feature/` — new features
- `fix/` — bug fixes
- `docs/` — documentation
- `refactor/` — code improvements
- `test/` — adding tests

#### **Step 5: Make Changes**
- Write clean, readable code

- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation

#### **Step 6: Test Your Changes**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pytest
python manage.py test

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm test
npm run build  # Check for build errors
```

#### **Step 7: Commit**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add weather caching system"
```

**Commit message format:**
- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation
- `style:` — formatting
- `refactor:` — code restructuring
- `test:` — adding tests
- `chore:` — maintenance

#### **Step 8: Push & Create Pull Request**
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then:
1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "Pull Request"

## Code Style Guidelines

### **Python (Backend)**
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings for functions
- Max line length: 100 characters
- Use `black` for formatting
- Use `flake8` for linting
```python
def get_weather_data(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> dict:
    """
    Fetch current weather data for given coordinates.
    
    Args:
        latitude: GPS latitude coordinate
        longitude: GPS longitude coordinate
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing weather data
        
    Raises:
        WeatherAPIError: If API request fails
    """
    # Implementation
```

### **JavaScript/TypeScript (Frontend)**
- Use TypeScript for new code
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use functional components (React)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Max line length: 100 characters
- Use Prettier for formatting
```typescript
interface WeatherData {
  temperature: number;
  condition: string;
  rain_mm: number;
}

const WeatherCard: React.FC = ({ data }) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

### **General Principles:**
- [✔] Clear, descriptive names
- [✔] Small, focused functions
- [✔] Comments for "why", not "what"
- [✔] DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- [✔] Error handling
- [x] No hardcoded values
- [x] No commented-out code
- [x] No console.log() in production

---

## Testing Guidelines

### **Backend Tests (pytest)**
```python
# backend/tests/test_attractions.py
def test_attraction_list_api():
    """Test that attraction list endpoint returns data"""
    response = client.get('/api/v1/attractions/')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert len(response.json()) > 0
```

### **Frontend Tests (Jest)**
```typescript
// frontend/__tests__/WeatherCard.test.tsx
describe('WeatherCard', () => {
  it('renders temperature correctly', () => {
    render();
    expect(screen.getByText('25°C')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**Coverage Goals:**
- Backend: 80%+ coverage
- Frontend: 70%+ coverage
- Critical paths: 100% coverage

---

## Database Changes

If your PR includes database changes:

1. **Create migration:**
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

2. **Test migration:**
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py migrate --fake-initial  # Test rollback
```

3. **Include migration file in PR**

4. **Document changes in PR description**
